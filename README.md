# Relativistic motion

This activity comes from W. Brian Lane, of Lets Code Physics fame. He's done a lot of good work in physics education, and I like to hang out with him at conferences.

## Assignment

Your assignment is to make something similar to Brian's result in Episode 6. See my comment on Brian's channel, to which he replied that if you add  `scene.camera.follow(rel)` before the loop, then the camera will follow the ball.
